# Predictive Text Recurrent Neural Nets Machine Learning App

This app uses recurrent neural nets to make predictions of entire sentences using a dataset which is book called metamorphosis. The author of this book is famous for his twisted ways of forming sentences, and this app makes sentences in ways that he would.

The App's output is seen in the png image, and as is noticable, as the number of iterations increase, the text predicted is much more readable, with many words being noticeable as well (in later iterations).

The app used adagrad to update the learning rate and optimise the model. It also used the negative log p method as the loss function to make it more suited to a recurrent neural net.
